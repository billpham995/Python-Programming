<h2> Description </h2>
<p> A collection of Python programming projects demonstrating problem-solving, algorithm development, and practical coding skills across various applications. Includes scripts, small tools, and exercises that showcase hands-on experience with Python </p>

<h2> Menu Python Project </h2>
<p> A Python menu-driven program that allows users to load, add, and display records, with an option to exit. The project is presented in three variations: the first version demonstrates the menu and data handling without using CSV files; the second version introduces CSV file integration for persistent storage; and the third version separates functionality across multiple Python files that work together modularly. This project highlights interactive console programming, file handling, modular code structure, and practical data management skills </p>
