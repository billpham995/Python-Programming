<h3> Menu GHS </h3>
<p> Menu GHS is a collaborative Python project completed with two teammates for an assignment at Swinburne University of Technology. This version does not use CSV files; instead, it uses an integrated array table within the Python file. The program demonstrates fundamental menu programming, showing how arrays interact with specific functions. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python data structures and function design while enjoying the hands-on learning experience. </p>

<h3> Menu with CSV </h3>
<p> This version of the Menu project is an edited version of Menu GHS, modified by myself to introduce CSV file integration for data storage. By using CSV files, the program simulates real-world data management, allowing records to be saved and loaded persistently between sessions. This project helped me understand practical file handling in Python, working with structured data, and how menu-driven programs interact with external datasets. </p>

<h3> Menu with separated files </h3>
<p> This variation of the Menu project is an early test where I separated functions into multiple Python files instead of combining all code into one. This approach helped me understand modular programming and the divide-and-conquer principle, improving code organization, readability, and maintainability. </p>
